# Adding desktop software to Raspberry Pi OS Lite

Your Tiny Memex will arrive with Raspberry Pi OS (RPOS) Lite installed. It's the light-weight version of RPOS that is designed to work on devices that don't connect to a HDMI display so they don't need a graphical window manager.

If you want to connect an external display, keyboard, and mouse to use the Tiny Memex as a tiny desktop PC then you'll need to follow the instructions in the "Part 2 - Bring in the Furniture" section of [this update guide](https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=133691).

If you don't know or care which desktop manager to install then I suggest using the MATE which is documented in the "MATE GUI" section.
